The AI-based approach to optimal design of photonic structure of the sphere particles.

The model uses inverse design approach to create 5-layered spheres with a very low scattering efficiency. Namely, the partciles composed of these spheres do not reflect visible light much, thus making object almost invisible in the visible spectrum.
